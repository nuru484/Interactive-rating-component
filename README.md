## Overview

### The challenge

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned


```html
<h1> I learnt how to keep some html code hidden until certain conditions are using javascript and css together with the html</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  for css, I learnt more about media queries and some states of elements like the hover state.
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('For javascritp, I learnt how using loop and the DOM manipulation in real projects is all about. This project has given me the understanding that doing is different from learning.')
}
```

### Continued development

I hope to work more with projects involving much javascript with much logic.


### Useful resources

ChatGPT has been my guide through this project and it's really helpful for beginers like, though I don't rely on it completly: https://chat.openai.com/
